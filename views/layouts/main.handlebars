            Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend
            to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look
            like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.
